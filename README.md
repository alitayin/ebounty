### About

This is a bounty tool built for [koush](https://twitter.com/e_Koush) to motivate the ecash community. 

This is an MVP. Notion is used as the CMS backend. It has good scalability and collaboration. It can be written and distributed by multiple people in real time. As a renderer, [super.so](http://super.so/) provides an excellent custom component library, CDN and hosting services are provided by [vercel.com](http://vercel.com/), and the front-end framework is React.

The main js and css have been partially changed to meet the needs of customization, and most styles can be modified through these two files.
